Extensions
==========

WNTR extensions are intended to house beta and self-contained functionality that adds to WNTR, 
but is not part of core WNTR development.  
Outside developers interested in contributing to WNTR extensions should communicate with the core development team
through https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR/issues prior to submitting a pull request.

While documentation is required for extensions, the documentation is not considered part of the 
WNTR user manual and is only available online.
Testing should be run through the extensions workflow.
See :ref:`developer_instructions` section for more information on contributing to WNTR.

WNTR currently includes the following extension:

- :ref:`stormwater`

Additional extensions will be added at a later date.
